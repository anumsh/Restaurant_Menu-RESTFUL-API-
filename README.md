# Item-Catalog (Restaurant-Menu)
This application provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration(google or facebook) and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.It utilizes Flask, SQL Alchemy, JQUERY, CSS, Java Script, and OAUTH 2 to create an Item catalog website.


This repository includes the exercise that I have solved in this Nanodegree project and Item catalog project  too.
